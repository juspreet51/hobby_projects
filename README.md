# Hobby Projects
A collation repository for all the hobby cum fun projects implemented by me. Not the best resource for learning or upskilling, as most of it was result of
a fun/crazy ideas over weekend, and rest of others are result of super fun/crazy ideas over long-weekends.

Some of the projects involved in this repo include:
- Apriori & FPGrowth Based Market Basket Analysis
- Facial Recognition Using FaceNet
- BERT And Its Flavors
- Fraudlent Credit Card Transaction Classification
- Credit/Loan Default Prediction
